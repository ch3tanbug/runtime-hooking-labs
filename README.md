# 🔧 Frida Android Challenge Series

All the credits for creating the labs go to [DERE-ad2001 on GitHub](https://github.com/DERE-ad2001/Frida-Labs).

Welcome to the **Frida Android Challenge Series** – a lightweight set of Android APKs designed to help you learn and experiment with **Frida** for dynamic instrumentation and mobile app security.

> These aren't advanced Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges – they're intentionally simple, designed to help you get comfortable with Frida’s core concepts and APIs.

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is for **learning**, not competition. Each APK represents a small challenge that encourages you to:
- Explore how runtime hooking works
- Practice using Frida to manipulate Android app behavior
- Understand how others write and use Frida scripts

While each APK includes a flag, **finding the flag isn’t the main goal**. The goal is to try multiple Frida-based techniques to reach the solution.

---

## 📦 Contents

- All challenge APKs are placed directly in the root of this repository.
- There are **no solutions provided** – you're encouraged to approach each challenge creatively.
- Challenges are organized to gradually increase in complexity, from beginner to intermediate level.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

If you're new to Frida, here’s what you need:
- A basic understanding of Android apps and APK structure
- A rooted Android device or emulator (or one with `frida-server` running)
- Frida installed on your machine (`pip install frida-tools`)

Start with the simplest APK and try hooking into methods, changing return values, and bypassing logic to reach the flag.
